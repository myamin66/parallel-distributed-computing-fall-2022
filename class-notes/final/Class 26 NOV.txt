Microservices

docker run -it container_name

containers: rocket, dockers
kubernetes: general container managent platform
ochestration platform= managent platform
nick name = k8s(numero names)
i18n = internationalization

container keeps values 
actual state 
desired state

for example, when in manifest, we say i need 4 
containers, but in actual got 2 container
when mismatch
schedular will create extra 2 container with the
help of API and worker node.

best practice 
run one container in one pod

cube proxy(communication between pods)

cAdvisor: to generate statics

worker nodes, kubelets, minnions

a kubernetes cluseter must have at least 1 master node and one worker node

Cloud Storage
-----------------------
- store and transmit data on cloud
- different paying plans, fixed or how much used

classification
ephemeral storage: storage device with VM, when vm vanished it also gone. (non-persistent)
persistenant storage: Even without VM it will reside there.


types of persistent storage

1) file
2) block
3) object 

but in computer
primary storage: directly connect memory (volatile), Though Bios in ROM is primary storage but its non-volatile.
secondary storage: computer needs ports, ssds (non-volatile)
tertuary : removable (USBs)

previously
firstly cashe
Then Directly attached (usb,hdd, ssd), cheap but not-shareable
Network attached storage: issue was slow
Then it was used with fiber: Storage are network
Object storage: Distributed networks

RAID: redundatnt aray of independant disk, raid configurations replicate data, if one hard drive crash other survives and remains data
linux has file sysem of ext3 
windows has now ntfs, previously fat32
hard drive has partitions, p1, p2, etc

file based storage vs block storage

files also works on blocks
file is saved in ters of blocks, if one line changes, only that block changees

block base: access blocks directly.

Object storage:
	usually unstructured data, so not in files not blocks we use objects.
	attach id with data, and we access that data through HTTP with the help of id.
storage area network	
	we directly access blocks in SAN
meta-data = data about data
tells how to access this file, and in what blocks these file is present
