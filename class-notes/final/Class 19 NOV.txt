Dockerfile -> set of instructions to build image

every command of dockerfile in capital

FROM ubuntu
RUN  (to execute command)
MAINTAINER (author description)
COPY (file copy from local machine to container)
ADD (from internet to your container)
EXPOSE (to open ports)
ENV (key value pair)

container has no ip_address, but it has its own ports and we match it with host machine

FROM ubuntu
WORKDIR /tmp
